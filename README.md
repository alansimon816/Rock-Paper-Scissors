This program implements the classic game of rock, paper, scissors. The user is welcomed with a "Start Game" splash screen and can click the "Start Game" button to play the game. The game pits a user against a computer in multiple rounds of rock, paper, scissors. The user clicks on either the rock, paper, or scissors icon to input their choice. Their choice is then compared against the computer's and the winner of a round is determined immediately after. The first player to win 3 rounds is the winner of the game. A running score is kept in the upper corners of the web page. Upon win/loss of the game, user is presented with an end game screen that allows them to play again if they desire.

This project provided an excellent insight into creating interactive webpages via Javascript. The concept of "switching screens" was made possible via JS manipulation of the document-object model tree, which allowed for changing of an element's CSS value for the visiblity property. The possbility of making images into inputs was explored. Centering of elements via CSS was involved, as well as Flexbox concepts. This project served as an introduction into how I could make back-end game logic turn into real time visual feedback in JavaScript.
